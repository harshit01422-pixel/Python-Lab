# Experiment–3

## Title

Study of Sets and Dictionaries in Python

---

## Aim

To study the Python programming interface for collection types, specifically understanding the syntax, characteristics, and built-in functions of **Sets** and **Dictionaries**. 

---

## Objectives

* To understand the Python programming environment and interface for data structures. 


* To learn the syntax and rules for defining Sets and Dictionaries. 


* To study the unique properties of Sets, such as unordered elements and uniqueness. 


* To understand the Key-Value pair mechanism used in Dictionaries. 


* To study the different built-in functions and operators used for collection manipulation.

## Theory

### 1. Python Sets

A **Set** is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed. In Python, sets are written with curly brackets `{}`. 

* 
**Unordered:** The items in a set do not have a defined order and cannot be referred to by an index. 


* 
**Unique Elements:** Sets do not allow duplicate values; if a duplicate is added, it is ignored. 


* 
**Dynamic Membership:** While the items are unchangeable, you can add new items or remove existing ones at any time. 



### 2. Python Dictionaries

A **Dictionary** is a collection used to store data values in `key:value` pairs. It is similar to a real-world map or directory. 

* 
**Keys and Values:** Each element is a pair consisting of a unique key and an associated value. 


* 
**Identifiers as Keys:** Keys must follow the rules for identifiers (case-sensitive, no starting digits) and must be unique. 


* 
**Mutable:** Dictionaries allow for the changing, adding, or removing of items after the dictionary has been created. 



### 3. Basic Syntax and Functions

Python provides specific built-in functions to interact with these data types: 

* 
**`type()`**: Used to identify if a variable is a `set` or a `dict`. 


* 
**`len()`**: Returns the number of items in the collection. 


* 
**`set()` / `dict()**`: Constructor functions used to convert other data types (like lists) into sets or dictionaries. 


* 
**Input/Output**: Values can be accepted via `input()` and displayed using `print()`. 



### 4. Operators for Collections

* 
**Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)**: Used to check if a specific key or element exists within the collection. 


* 
**Set Operators**: Includes Union (`|`), Intersection (`&`), and Difference (`-`) to compare multiple sets. 


* 
**Assignment Operators**: Used to update dictionary values or add new elements (`=`, `+=`).

## Conclusion

Thus, the Python programming environment for Sets and Dictionaries was studied. We understood how Sets manage unique data and how Dictionaries utilize key-value pairs to organize information effectively.
