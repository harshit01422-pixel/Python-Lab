## Title
Python Environment, Data Types, Operators, and Basic Input/Output

## Aim
To study the Python programming environment and interface, understand execution modes, variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output operations in Python.

## Objectives
To understand the Python programming environment and interface
To study Python execution modes
To understand comments in Python
To learn variables, identifier rules, and data types
To study different operators and expressions
To understand basic input and output mechanisms
## Theory
### 1. Python Environment and Interface
The Python environment provides tools and interfaces to write, execute, and debug Python programs. Python programs can be executed using different interfaces such as:

Python Shell
Jupyter Notebook
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code
Cloud-based platforms like Google Colab
These interfaces allow users to write code, execute instructions, and view results interactively.

### 2. Python Execution Modes
a) Interactive Mode
Commands are executed one line at a time
Immediate output is displayed
Useful for testing small code snippets and learning
Examples include Python Shell, Jupyter Notebook cells, and Google Colab
b) Script Mode
Programs are written in a file and executed as a whole
Suitable for developing complete applications
Files usually have a .py extension
### 3. Comments in Python
Comments are non-executable statements used to explain code and improve readability.

Single-line comments begin with #
Multi-line comments are written using triple quotes (""" """)
Comments help in documentation and understanding program logic.

### 4. Variables and Identifiers
A variable is a named memory location used to store data values.

Rules for Identifiers
Must start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or underscore _
Cannot start with a digit
Case-sensitive
Should not use Python keywords
Python uses dynamic typing, meaning variables do not require explicit data type declaration.

### 5. Data Types in Python
Python provides several built-in data types to store different kinds of data.

Basic Data Types
Integer (int): Whole numbers
Floating-point (float): Decimal numbers
String (str): Sequence of characters
Boolean (bool): True or False
The data type of a variable can be identified using the type() function.

### 6. Operators and Expressions
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

Types of Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational Operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
Logical Operators: and, or, not
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=
Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, <<, >>
An expression is a combination of operators and operands that produces a result.

### 7. Basic Input and Output Operations
Input and output operations allow interaction between the user and the program.

Input
The input() function is used to accept input from the user
Input is treated as a string by default and may require type conversion
Output
The print() function is used to display output
Formatted output can be achieved using commas or formatted strings
